# 🔐 RSA Encryption (#03_rsa_encryption)

> 📌 Algorithm from [Ultimate Algorithm Blueprint](https://jawadabbasi14.github.io/the-ultimate-algorithm-blueprint/)

## 📚 Description
RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm used for secure data transmission. It uses a **public key** for encryption and a **private key** for decryption.
